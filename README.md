Personal projects I've worked on through different platforms, such as Codecademy, Hack the Box, FreeCodeCamp, Scrimba, Educative, etc. It includes a wide variety of things I've done, such as programming, scripts, CTF writeups and automated tools I made for fun. Enjoy.

## Fun Projects I've Taken On:
- Set up an Ubuntu Server (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).
    - Redirected it's IP to point to a **dynamic DNS**.
    - Memed its default SSH port with the **[Endlessh](https://github.com/skeeto/endlessh)** tarpit to stop script kiddies and bots.
    - Configured it to run **Synapse**, a **[Matrix](https://matrix.org/) homeserver implementation**. ([@dpizarrow](https://github.com/dpizarrow) helped a lot, check him out!)
