## Navigating this directory
Each subfolder represents a course. Inside it, you will find the projects I've developed through my learning process. Some projects might be accompanied with the ```_revised``` tag, signifying I've revisited the project and tried to rewrite the code in a more advanced and intuitive way, as some of the projects are oftentimes very basic.
